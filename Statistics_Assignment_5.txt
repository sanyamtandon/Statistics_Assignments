Q1 How are you going to figure out the average height of trees in Karnataka?
Ans1 We can figure this out by using 2 different methods
     1. Central Limit Theorem : Take minimum 30 samples (each sample must include different species of trees) from different regions in the state, calculate
                                their average mean, it'll be nearly equal to the average height of trees in the state.
     2. Using Confidence Interval : Formula CI = Point Estimate +/- Margin Error
                                    For this method we'll have to make a few assumptions. Assumptions made are as below:
                                    1. Sample Mean = 12 feet or 366 cms
                                    2. P-Value (alpha) = 0.05 i.e we have 95% confidence and 5% equally distributed between the 2 tails i.e 0.025 at each 
                                       tail end.
                                    3. Standard Deviation = 100
                                    4. Sample size(n) = 30, So
                                    CI = Sample Mean +/- Z(alpha/2)*(SD/sqrt(n))
                                       = 366 +/- Z(0.05/2)*(100/sqrt(30))
                                       = 366 +/- Z(0.025)*18.28            [Z(0.025) = 1-0.025 = 0.975 (From Z-Table, 0.975=1.96)]
                                       = 366 +/- (1.96*18.28)
                                       = 366 +/- 35.82  = [330.18 to 401.82] This should be the range within which average height of trees in Karnataka can lie


Q2 What is Hypotheisis testing and How does it work?
Ans2 In Hypotheisis tesing there are 2 hypotheisis
     1. Null Hypotheisis - Here it is assumed that everything is same/fair or equal
     2. Alternate Hypotheisis - Unequal probability/biased
     We do Hypotheisis Testing to prove whether a claim is true or not, If the claim falls withing the range of Null hypotheisis then alternate hypotheisis
     is rejected and the claim is said to be true whereas vice-versa if the claim falls within either of the two tails.
     For Example : If we have p-value = 0.05(as determined by the domain experts) then it means 95% confidence, hence 0.025 of the distribution on both of
     the tails i.e Region Including either of the tails = 1-0.025 = 0.975  [From Z-Table 0.975 gives 1.96].
     So, if the claim lies between [-1.96 to +1.96] -> Null Hypotheisis is accepted and Alternate Hypotheisis is rejected while if the claim is
     <-1.96 or >1.96 then Alternate Hypotheisis is accepted and Null Hypotheisis is rejected. 


Q3 Explain the difference between Alpha and Beta errors.Which inaccuracy is the most hazardous?
Ans3 Alpha Error means Type 1 error i.e Null Hypthotheisis(H0) is rejected and Alternate Hypotheisis(H1) is accepted whereas Beta Error means Type 2 error
     i.e Alternate Hypotheisis(H1) is rejected and Null Hypotheisis(H0) is accepted.
     Which Error is the most hazardous, honestly, it depends as in one instance, the Type I(Alpha) error may have consequences that are less acceptable than those 
     consequences of a Type II error. In another case, the Type II error(Beta) could be less costly than a Type I error.   


Q4 What is the significance of p-value?
Ans4 P-value or alpha is basically the probability for null hypotheisis to be true 
     eg. Let's consider spacebar in our keyboard, it is long enough and has left,right ends and a center as well but maximum number of time user presses 
     only at the center as comapred to the times he/she presses left/right extreme ends. If P-value of center = 0.8 then it means that it that if we
     repeat the same experiment(pressing the spacebar) a 100 times then the number of times we touch at the center is 80.


Q5 What is the Probability Distribution Function and How does it work?
Ans5  In statistics, a PDA(Probability Distribution Function) gives us all the possible values and likelihoods that a random variable(either discrete or
      continuous) can take within a given range. It even tells us the population mean, standard deviation, variance, skewness in the data(wheter it is 
      left skewed/right skewed or equally distributed across mean). It is generally a bell curve.
