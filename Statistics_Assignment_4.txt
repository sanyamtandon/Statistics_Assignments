Q1 What is the defination of covariance? Create the formula for it.
Ans1 Covariance between 2 variables tells us the relation(inter-dependency) between 2 different variables. i.e whether the 2 variables are directly 
     proportional or inversely proportional to each other.
     Formula : Cov(x,y) = Summation i=1 to n [(x-Mean(x))(y-Mean(y))]/n-1


Q2 What makes correlation better than covariance?
Ans2 We have 2 correlation coefficients namely Pearson's correlation and Spearman's rank correlation both these correlation gives us values between the 
     range [-1 to 1] i.e there is a upper bound and a lower bound on the values which helps us in determining that how positively/negatively are the 2 
     variables correlated whereas in covariance both positive/negative values don't have any limit. It helps in telling us that whether the 2 variables are 
     positively/negatively correlated but not to what extent are they correlated. Hence, correlation is better as values close to 1 tell us that the 2 
     varibles are highly positively correlated where as 0 means that both variables aren't correlated at all while value close to -1 tells us that they are 
     highly negatively correlated.


Q3 Explain the process as well as Pearson's and Spearman's Correlation coefficient.
Ans3 Pearson's correlation coefficient ranges between [-1 to 1] it tells us how positively/negatively are the two variables correlated. It is denoted by row
     and is given by Pearson's Correlation Coefficient(row) = Cov(x,y)/(Standard Deviation x * Standard Deviation y)
     where Cov(x,y) = Summation i=1 to n [(x-Mean(x))(y-Mean(y))]/n-1
           Standard Deviation x = Summation i=1 to n sqrt((x-Mean(x))^2/n-1)
     whereas Spearman's correlation coefficient also ranges between [-1 to 1] and is denoted by r. It is given by
     r = Cov(rank(x),rank(y))/(SD(rank(x)*SD(rank(y))


Q4 What are the advantages of Spearman's Correlation over Pearson's Correlation?
Ans4 Ideally if variable x increases with increase in the value of variable y at very step then correlation value should be 1 i.e 100% correlation but it 
     has been observed in case of Pearson's correlation that if the growth is slow i.e values of 1 variable are increasing with increase in the value of 
     other variable but at a slower rate then the Pearson's value is less than 1, Hence Spearman's correlation coefficient was introduced as it overcomes 
     this and it's value isn't depend on the rate of increase/decrease.

Q5 Describe Central Limit theorem.
Ans5 Central Limit Theorem states that if we take minimum 30 samples and then compute the average sample mean, it is closer to the actual population mean.
     basically it tells that more the sample size, higher is the accuracy to make generalisations for population data/mean based on the sample data/mean
